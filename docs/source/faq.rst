Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What to do when the html output window is blank?
  - This can occur when you are not properly connected to the internet. Check
    your internet connection and try again.
  - If you are connected to the internet, close the blank output window and
    re-execute your command. The first time that an html output window opens,
    it needs to download the style sheets from the internet. Once the style
    sheets are downloaded, they are be stored in the brower's cache and the
    output window should display the html content.
  - Note that the output window that opens when the output format is set to
    :guilabel:`auto` is also an html output window.
