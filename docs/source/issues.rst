Known issues
============


Windows GUI
-----------
GUI response to mouse button clicks
    On Windows the GUI does not respond to the start of the mouse button click,
    but only to the release of the mouse button. This means that a click and
    hold action on a GUI input element will not have any effect.


macOS GUI
---------
GUI selection boxes
    On macOS, the GUI selection boxes are not displayed correctly. They should be
    blue, but are displayed as grey. The right selection color can be obtained by
    desecting the GUI window, and then reselecting it.
