Introduction
------------
The Python ``gitinspectorgui`` tool facilitates detailed quantative analysis of
the contribution of each author to selected repositories. The tool comes with a
GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface) interface.
Executable apps are available for Mac and Windows.

Origin
------
Development of GitinspectorGUI started as an update and extension of the
`gitinspector <https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector>`_ tool by Adam Waldenberg.
Recently, GitinspectorGUI has been completely rewritten and has been released
under the permissive `MIT license <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_.
