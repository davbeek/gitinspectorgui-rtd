Overview
========

Introduction
------------
The Python ``gitinspectorgui`` tool facilitates detailed quantative analysis of
the contribution of each author to selected repositories. The tool comes with a
GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface) interface.
Executable apps are available for Mac and Windows.

Origin
------
GitinspectorGUI is an extension and update of the gitinspector tool by Adam
Waldenberg. It is based on a fork from the `GitHub gitinspector repository
<https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector>`_. As such, the original GPLv3 license
and copyrights of the gitinspector tool apply unchanged.

Aim
---
We hope that gitinspectorgui will eventually be incorporated in the  `GitHub
gitinspector repository <https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector>`_. Until that
time, we provide our extension of gitinspector as a separate repository at: *to
be defined*.

Authors
-------
Gitinspector was written by Adam Waldenberg. It has been extended and updated by
the GitinspectorGUI team:

* Jingjing Wang: python functionality.
* Bert van Beek: documentation and design.
